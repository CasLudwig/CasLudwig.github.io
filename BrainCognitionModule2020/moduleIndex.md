# Cas Ludwig's Module: Decision making

The topic of my module is decision making. I will go through the psychology of decision making and the underlying neural mechanisms. These pages represent my lecture notes. I started out writing these for my own benefit, but over the course of doing so I figured students might benefit from having access to this material. *This is by no means intended as a polished, online textbook and you should not rely on this material exclusively for your assignments.* However, I think this is a flexible way for me to point students to relevant material, cool demos and go through some material in greater depth than is possible in the recorded content.
