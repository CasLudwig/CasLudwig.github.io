In my lab we study how visual information is used in the control of behaviour, as manifest in motor actions. In particular, I am interested in the decision processes that govern (i) how we actively sample information from the environment by shifting gaze, (ii) how the sampled information is used to draw inferences about the state of the environment, and (iii) how these inferences guide our motor behaviour. The methods I use include eye tracking, visual psychophysics, motion capture, and computational modelling.
